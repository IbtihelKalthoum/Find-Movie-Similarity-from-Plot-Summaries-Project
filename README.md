## üé¨ Project Description
Venturing into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project delves into the challenge of gauging movie similarities based on their plot summaries sourced from IMDb and Wikipedia. NLP provides a conduit to develop algorithms that comprehend the conversational language, giving a fascinating perspective on content analysis.

Our dataset encapsulates the titles and plot summaries of IMDb's top 100 movies, presenting a compelling challenge for deriving correlations.

## üìã Project Tasks
1. **Data Observation**: Import and get acquainted with the dataset.
2. **Data Merging**: Combine IMDb and Wikipedia plot summaries for a comprehensive dataset.
3. **Tokenization**: Break text into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements.
4. **Stemming**: Reduce words to their root/base form.
5. **Streamlined Text Processing**: Club together Tokenize & Stem functionalities.
6. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Initialize and create the TfidfVectorizer.
7. **Vector Transformation**: Fit and transform the TfidfVectorizer.
8. **Clustering**: Import KMeans and determine clusters within the dataset.
9. **Similarity Assessment**: Calculate the similarity distance amongst movies.
10. **Dendrogram Plotting**: Incorporate Matplotlib, Linkage, and Dendrograms for hierarchical representation.
11. **Final Analysis**: Ascertain the most similar movies based on processed data.
